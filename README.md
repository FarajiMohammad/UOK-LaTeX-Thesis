## 📁 LaTeX File Structure

This project is organized into several folders and key files as follows:

---

### 📁 **Bibs**

Contains the bibliography file:

* `Ref.bib`: Stores all your citation entries. Add your references here using BibTeX format.

### 📁 **Chapters**

Includes the main body content of your thesis, organized by topic:

* `Introduction.tex`
* `RelatedWork.tex`
* `ProposedMethod.tex`
* `Experimental.tex`
* `Conclusion.tex`

➤ You should place your thesis content into the appropriate file. For example, write your introduction in `Introduction.tex`, your methodology in `ProposedMethod.tex`, and so on.

➤ To add additional chapters (e.g., a pre-introduction), create a new `.tex` file in this folder and include it in the main file using:

```latex
\include{chapters/pre-intro}
```

### 📁 **Figures**

Place all your figures and images here. Subfolders are supported.

➤ To include an image in your document, use the following command:

```latex
\mysubfig{figures/Subfolder/your-figure.pdf}{Your image caption}
```

### 📁 **STR-Files**

Contains structured front matter and official university pages:

* `abstract-en.tex`: Write your abstract in English.
* `abstract-fa.tex`: Write your abstract in Persian.
* `acknowledgements.tex`: A page to thank those who supported you during the thesis.
* `submission-en.tex`: Fill in the English score and signature page.
* `submission-fa.tex`: Fill in the Persian score and signature page.
* `evaluation.tex`: Undertaking/commitment declaration.
* `TASVIR-en.tex`: Insert the English cover page with the green background.
* `TASVIR-fa.tex`: Insert the Persian cover page with the green background.

## 📄 Main LaTeX Files

* **`Mohammad.tex`**
  The main file to compile the full thesis. Use this to include all chapters and structure your document.

* **`preamble.tex`**
  Loads all necessary packages, commands, and global configurations. Typically does not require editing.

* **`glossaries.tex`**
  Add glossary terms, abbreviations, or technical definitions here.


## 📦 Compilation Notes

➤ Recommended to compile using **XeLaTeX** for best font and language support (especially for Persian/Unicode text).
To compile the TeX files into a PDF, use the make command. This process automatically handles multiple steps: it runs Biber (for managing bibliography with biblatex), Xindy (for generating two glossaries), and XeLaTeX (to produce the final PDF). The build process runs as many times as needed to resolve all cross-references correctly.
